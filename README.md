# Snowtrack

## Project report

This is a web app that keeps track of a skiers activity. It tracks what courses a skier has skied and what mountains they're on. It also tracks the distance and total ski time for the skier.

#### Things snowTrack should show on site:

* Who the skier is

* Where the skiers has skied

* For how long the skier has skied

* How many kilometers downhill

There was a rocky start to the project and took a long time before we got started with the actual development. But once we got started the project went well, with a fairly even distrubution of work. 
But since it took so long before we got started we've not had quite enough time to work on this project and it's therefore lacking in functonality and general polish. 
The project is hosted in a container through heroku.
